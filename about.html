    <div>About Me
        Introduction
        Hello! My name is Deborah Amuzu, and I'm a passionate web developer from [Your Location]. My journey into web development began when I discovered my love for creating and building digital experiences that connect people and ideas.
        
        Passion for Tech
        My interest in technology sparked during a high school computer class where I first learned about coding. It was thrilling to see how lines of code could transform into functional websites. Inspired by a friend who was a software engineer, I decided to dive deeper into the world of web development and turn my curiosity into a career.
        
        Journey into Web Development
        I started my learning path through a combination of online courses and self-study. I dedicated countless hours to mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which laid the foundation for my skills. Along the way, I explored frameworks like React and tools such as Git to enhance my development process.
        
        Challenges Overcome
        As a woman in a male-dominated field, I faced challenges that tested my resilience. There were times when I doubted my abilities, especially during complex projects. However, I found strength in community support, mentorship, and persistent self-improvement. These experiences taught me the importance of perseverance and fueled my desire to empower other women in tech.
